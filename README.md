# 📊 Buffett-Style Quant Stock Screener (Global + Korean Markets)

This Python program screens and scores stocks using **Buffett-style value investing principles**. It gathers the most recent financial data from:

- 🇺🇸 **Yahoo Finance (yfinance)**  
- 🌏 **FMP API (Financial Modeling Prep)**  
- 🇰🇷 **Naver Finance** and **KRX (KOSPI/KOSDAQ)**  

The program computes scores based on profitability, valuation, debt, and other fundamentals and exports results to a **clean Excel file**, providing practical insight to investors.

| Metric              | Rule / Threshold                                               | Score Impact        |
|---------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------|
| Debt-to-Equity      | ≤ 0.5                                                          | +1                  |
| Current Ratio       | Between 1.5 and 2.5                                            | +1                  |
| Price-to-Book (P/B) | ≤ 1.5                                                          | +1                  |
| Return on Equity    | ≥ 8-10%                                                           | +1                  |
| Return on Assets    | ≥ 5-6%                                                           | +1                  |
| Dividend Trend      | Positive 10Y growth ≥ 10% → +1.5, ≥ 8% → +1, ≥ 6% → +0.5       | +0.5 ~ +1.0        |
| EPS Trend           | Positive 3Y CAGR or strong growth                              | -1 ~ +1             |
| PEG Ratio           | PEG < 1 (if EPS & PER available)                               | +1                  |
| Interest Coverage   | ≥ 5x                                                           | +1                  |
| Industry Comparison | High PER & low ROE → -2~-3; low PER & strong ROE → +1~+2          | -2 ~ +2             |
| Momentum (3m,6m,12m)| Scores based on designated weights on each time window         | -1 ~ +1             |
| Cyclicity (optional)| Scores based on whether the stock is cyclical, defensive, or politically-themed | -1 ~ +1             |

Higher scores indicate better Buffett-style value candidates. You can add your own quant ideas on top of these basic conditions.
